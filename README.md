# Logistical_Regression
In this project we will be working with the UCI adult dataset. We will be attempting to predict if people in the data set belong in a certain class by salary, either making <=50k or >50k per year.

#### Step 01.Data Description:
- In this first section the data will be collected and studied. The missing values will be threated or removed.  First, all the '?' values are changed to N/A's and then deleted. Using the Amelia package we can create a missing map, essentially a heat map pointing out missing values.  Finally, a initial data description will carried out to know the data. Therefore some calculations of descriptive statistics will be made, such as kurtosis, skewness, media, fashion, median and standard deviation.  

#### Step 02. Feature Engineering:


#### Step 03. Data Filtering:
- There are a lot of columns that are cateogrical factors, however a lot of these columns have too many factors than may be necessary. In this data filtering section we'll try to clean these columns up by reducing the number of factors.

#### Step 04. Exploratory Data Analysis:


#### Step 05. Model Deployment:


#### Step 06. Conclusion:

## 4.0 Conclusion


## 5.0 Lessons Learned
- Data Cleansing
